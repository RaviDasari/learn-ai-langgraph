LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, built on top of (and intended to be used with) LangChain.
It extends the LangChain Expression Language with the ability to coordinate multiple chains (or actors) across multiple steps of computation in a cyclic manner.
It is inspired by Pregel and Apache Beam.
The main use case is for adding cycles to your LLM application.
Crucially, LangGraph allows you to define flows that involve cycles, which are essential for most agentic architectures.
LangGraph allows you to define a graph where nodes are functions and edges are the control flow.
State is maintained across the graph execution.
